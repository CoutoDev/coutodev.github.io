Do ✨vibe coders✨ also care about the aesthetics of the code, or is it just code that works in the best go horse mode that counts?

Before you defend your friend Gepeto, give me a chance to explain what I meant in the provocation above!

The aesthetics of code go far beyond “making it pretty”: it's a strategy for clarity, maintenance and collaboration. Just as in chess, where an organized board allows you to visualize possibilities and threats, well-formatted and structured code facilitates quick decisions and reduces errors.

These days, when we have more and more AI-generated code, it's not difficult to lose control over the formatting and stylization of a project. Maintaining a standard wasn't easy even before that (ctrl+c / ctrl+v from the stackoverflows of life be damned), but with the ever-increasing use of these tools, this task can become a real nightmare if we don't have ways of guaranteeing the same code structure.

There are different automated ways to ensure that we are following the same aesthetic (but not limited to this) throughout the project. ESLint and Prettier, as well as various tools for analyzing static code, can and should be used in projects that go into production. This way, we can guarantee that, even when using AIs as code generators, the output will be formatted as expected, and if any violations of the defined rules are found, they will be easily detected both by humans and by our friend Gepeto (who can self-correct).

Thinking about this when working in teams is fundamental and necessary. The aesthetics of the code serve as a “common language” in these cases. A consistent style eliminates the need for debates about formatting and allows everyone to focus on what really matters: logic and architecture. This makes code reviews more productive and less stressful, as well as facilitating collaboration between people of different levels of experience.

It's important to emphasize that this isn't just a matter of taste or whim, but a strategy that, if well applied, can be an essential factor in increasing your team's productivity, as well as reducing bugs and facilitating the maintenance and sustainable evolution of the software in question.

Small details, such as standardization and visual organization, are what set high-performance teams and professionals apart.
