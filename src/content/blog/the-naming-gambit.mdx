One thing is certain:

We may never be able to unlock all the secrets and possibilities that emerge from these two crossroads: Programming and chess.

Both arts involve strategy, dexterity, sacrifice and resilience. There are many similarities, but there are also differences.

The decision to choose a move on the board is irreversible. It's made. But unlike chess, in programming you can undo, redo and, most importantly of all, adhere to clean code.

But after all, what can be considered clean code? Uncle Bob has written an entire book on the subject, which I highly recommend you read!

In this series of posts I intend to cover some of the aspects of the famous Clean Code, bringing practical examples with a focus on the front end, but which can be applied to software development in general.

There's nothing better to start this topic than talking about one of the most difficult things in this area: giving things (good) names.

Knowing that this is a pain point for many of us (devs), we can see it as a small sacrifice that will pay off in the long run. And both you in the future and your fellow developers will be very grateful for your initial sacrifice.

Whether you're creating a CSS variable, a React component, a Redux state, a custom Hook or a simple utility function, giving it a meaningful name that is easily understood within its context is an arduous but fundamental task.

To finish with another chess analogy, remember: just as a Grandmaster can look at a board and instantly understand what is happening, a developer should be able to look at their code and immediately understand what it does.

White pieces move first in chess, and clear names move your code in the right direction from the start.
